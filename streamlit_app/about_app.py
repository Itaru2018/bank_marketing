                This web app predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit after a marketing campaign.

                - **XGBoost**(Model)

                Try the app via:
                - **Demo Mode** - Enter 4 features for a quick test
                - **Full Input Mode** - Use all 19 customer and economic variables

                The app works using a real-time ML pipeline:

                1. Streamlit collects your input
                2. FAST API receives and process the data
                3. FAST API loads a saved *XGBoost* model
                4. A trained **XGBoost** model returns:
                - The prediction(yes/no)
                - Probability
                - Decision threshold applied
